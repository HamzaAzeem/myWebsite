myWebsite
=========

Just put together some HTML5 and CSS code for a portfolio-type website. I really wanted to add some Javascript (jQuery and AngularJS) but found no need to (yet).

Status: In progress

Working pages: 4
  - Home
  - uWaterloo page (About the courses and stuff I'm taking at university)
  - Projects page
  - Resume
  - About Me
  
Yet to do:
  - Merge uWaterloo/Projects CSS into one stylesheet for better organization
  - Make navigation bar responsive
  - Make all pages responsive
  - Add a picture of me
  - ~~Add behaviour to Email, LinkedIn and Google+ pins~~
  - ~~Homepage BG slideshow?~~ Make it a smoother transition
  - ~~Fix "Year" links in uWaterloo page~~
  - ~~Change speed and font of btt button~~
