myWebsite
=========

Just put together some HTML5 and CSS code for a portfolio-type website. I really wanted to add some Javascript (jQuery and AngularJS) but found no need to (yet). Hence the 'Javascript Sandbox'.

- Status: In progress

- Working pages: 3
  - Home
  - Resume
  - About Me
  
- Yet to do:
  - Projects page
  - uWaterloo page (About the courses and stuff I'm taking at university)
  - Add behaviour to Email, LinkedIn and Google+ pins
  - Homepage BG slideshow?
