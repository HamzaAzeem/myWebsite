=========

Just put together some HTML5 and CSS code for a portfolio-type website.

**Status: In progress**

Working pages: 5
  - Home
  - uWaterloo page (About the courses and stuff I'm taking at university)
  - Projects page
  - Resume
  - About Me
  
To-do:
  - Make all pages "mobile-first" responsive
  - Fix margins for tablet resolutions
    - Add left/right margins to About Me page
  - Decrease '<h1>' font-size
