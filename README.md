Just put together some HTML5 and CSS code for a portfolio-type website. I really wanted to add some Javascript (jQuery and AngularJS) but found no need to (yet).

Status: In progress

Working pages: 4
  - Home
  - uWaterloo page (About the courses and stuff I'm taking at university)
  - Resume
  - About Me
  
Yet to do:
  - Projects page
  - Add behaviour to Email, LinkedIn and Google+ pins
  - Homepage BG slideshow?
  - Fix "Year" links in uWaterloo page
  - Change speed and font of btt button
  - Add a picture of me
