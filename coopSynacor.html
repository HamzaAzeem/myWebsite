		                	Things got switched up a bit this time around, but for the better. I'm talking about the size, environment and work at the company that I am now hired at this term. In a nutshell, <b>Synacor Inc.</b> is a company that specializes in creating full-scale applications for companies they contract. Their revenue model is pretty interesting and has a lot of aspects to it, but I won't get into that here.

		                	Synacor Inc. is an established company running for over a decade now with a stock up in NASDAQ (SYNC). They aren't as big as Rogers (unsurprisingly), but they are still pretty cool in what they do; at least what <i>I</i> got to do. I was put on the App Platform team consisting of less than 20 members in all three of their offices in Canada and the US.

		                	Right from the get-go I made a couple of web apps using mostly vanilla Javascript with an MV* framework similar to that of 
		                	<a href="https://muut.com/riotjs/">Riot.js</a>. I have to say that using vanilla Javascript really makes you think about almost everything going into your app.

		                	Simply from being on my own and coding away all day I learned not only the technical aspects of the technologies I was using but something that I believe is far more important: the ability to learn, think and apply. What I mean by that is persevering through difficult concepts until you finally find that spark that sets that lightbulb off. You hack away at what you just found and try to make sense of it by transforming your research into something that works for you. Then it doesn't work. So you think some more. Then you open up the Googles and Stack Overflows and search some more. Learn, think and apply. You keep repeating that so often that even though it seems you took forever in accomplishing that task (and it may not even have turned out as well as you expected!), but you implicity increased your skill of acquiring, understanding and implementing knowledge, regardless of the field.
