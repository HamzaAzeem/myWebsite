                <h1>Hi there!</h1>
                <p class="intro">
                My name is Hamza. I am currently a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                I started learning to code in high school, and my first "Hello World" was in Java. I've learned much since then, but it's still nothing compared to what's out there. As far as front-end development goes, I am mostly self-taught.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                I have this natural inclination to learn things. Seriously, like anything...but subjects related to science and technology pique my interest the most. Design skills are something that I recently learned I have an aptitude for, but still needs much improvement. Oh yeah, practical life/work skills come in handy too.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                Despite having been engulfed by technology, I still enjoy spending time outside (in the summer, when it's not a sub-zero disaster), socializing, exercising, doodling, beatboxing, reading, watching movies and all that other normal people stuff.
