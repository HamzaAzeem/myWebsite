					<h1>Co-op (Winter 2014)</h1>
					<section class="visibility">
						<p>
							I landed my first co-op at <b>Rogers Telecommunications Inc.</b> One of the three major telecommunication corporations in Canada.<br /><br />

							My job as a Web Developer was to help work on the interface for the company's landing page after a user logs into their account. Through this job I managed to learn useful web technologies and build professional skills that will help me in the future. Probably the most notable improvement of my "soft-skills" is my ability to communicate. Whether it be a friend or a stranger, I have come to notice that I am more comfortable in exchanging dialogue in a more professional and confident manner.<br /><br />

							Of course my goal for this co-op term, more than anything, was to learn as much as I can through whatever means necessary. In large corporations such as Rogers, it is important that as a co-op student you take initiative for having your boss or team lead give you work. Otherwise you might as well learn nothing new from the experience. I ended up receiving instruction from my team lead to learn some front-end technologies if I am to consider myself capable of working alongside them on their projects.<br /><br />

							In just a couple of weeks I reinforced my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery from ground up and learned some new concepts along the way. On top of that I learned a new framework called AngularJS that supposedly has a steep learning curve. Although I agree that it is not easy, as long is you have a deadline to meet and are committed to learning a new skill, then it makes the process of learning much more bearable and even enjoyable. To prove to myself that I understand what I have learned I incorporated my new set of knowledge of web development into making my own <a href="http://github.com/HamzaAzeem/myWebsite" target="_blank">website</a> (from HTML, CSS, and jQuery) and a SPA (Single Page Application) called <a href="http://github.com/HamzaAzeem/Fastask" target="_blank">Fastask</a> that was built on AngularJS and styled with Bootstrap 3. Fortunately, I made a friend who was adept in the AngularJS framework. He asked if I can help contribute to <a href="http://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps" target="_blank">his project</a> that he wanted to get noticed on Github.<br /><br />

							I wasn't totally satisfied with just learning front-end, so I got familiar with version control and Apache Ant with the help of some co-workers working in back-end. They had me use a software by IBM called Rational Team Concert where I can fork their team's repositories and commit my work through SVN and compile any builds with the help of Apache Ant. I had not completely learned what there was to learn about them, but it did get me interested in more of the work of managing/working with environments. Hopefully I'll learn more of these technologies in my next co-op term.<br /><br />

							Along with providing input in the project code for designing the rogers.com website, I took on the task of testing the webpage under specific test cases across various mobile platforms. This involved documenting any inconsistencies with the case description with screenshots and comments compiled under the company's required format. I went downtown to Rogers HQ after getting permission and took a 1-day course in a software used to remotely access the testing devices from any computer called Perfecto-Mobile: Mobile Automation. It was quite beneficial and I learned how to run scripts using the test automation software's UI as well.<br /><br />

							It was a wonderful experience at Rogers with its lively environment and colourful building. Despite the enjoyment I felt as I went to work each day I want to explore my options a bit in a different company; perhaps a hardware-related job, or a smaller company where the community is more closely knit, or one where I can learn more back-end development.

						<p>My second term! I'm not going to lie. I was kind of excited for this term given the more interesting course line-up compared to 1A:</p><br />
						<dl>
							<dt>ECE-100B</dt>
							<dd>
								Similar to ECE-100A. Professional practice in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Explores areas of research and concepts from other Engineering discplines and offers material for academic term, co-op and professional/career development.
							</dd>
							<dt>ECE-103</dt>
							<dd>
								Discrete Mathematics. Truth tables, logical operators, set theory, implications, finite automata, temporal logic, various proof methods including direct proofs, induction and contradictions.
							</dd>
							<dt>ECE-106</dt>
							<dd>
								A shift from classical physics to electromagnetism. This course teaches us the physics of what goes on in electrical circuits which was learned in ECE-140. The labs in this course are very similar to the labs done in ECE-140, where equipment such as Analog/Digital Multimeters, Oscilloscopes and Function Generators are used. This course assumes we know how to read schematics and implement a circuit from it.
							</dd>
							<dt>ECE-124</dt>
							<dd>
								Digital Circuits and Systems. More to do with Digital Logic than Analog circuits(ECE-140). Labs are key in this course. We learn VHDL and program FPGAs for various purposes (e.g. Traffic Light Controller, ALU, Car Controller) via Altera Quartus II FPGA design software.
							</dd>
							<dt>ECE-155</dt>
							<dd>
								Engineering Design and Embedded Systems. A fun and unique class which centers around the labs done across the term. These labs require us to implement Java in Eclipse to create Android apps with the Android SDK and submit our work through Subclipse (SVN Plug-in for Eclipse). Labs include making an app that reads all sensor values of a device in realtime and use those values to create a pedometer, a GPS, and more.
							</dd>
							<dt>MATH-119</dt>
							<dd>
								Calculus 2 for Engineers. A continuation of MATH-117. Learn approximation methods (linear approximation, interpolation, Taylor polynomials, Newton's Method, Landau order symbol), infinite series (Taylor series and Taylor's Remainder Theorem, geometric/power/convergence test series), optimization and vector-valued functions.
							</dd>
